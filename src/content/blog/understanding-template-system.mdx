# Understanding Craft's Template System

Ever wondered what happens behind the scenes when you create a new project in Craft? In this technical deep dive, we'll explore the template system that powers every Craft project.

## The Foundation

Every Craft project starts with a carefully crafted template that includes:

- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **React 19** with the latest features
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling
- **shadcn/ui** for accessible components
- **Prisma** for database operations

But it's not just about the technologies – it's about how they're configured to work together seamlessly.

## Project Structure

When you create a new project, here's what gets generated:

```
my-project/
├── src/
│   ├── app/                 # Next.js App Router pages
│   │   ├── layout.tsx       # Root layout with providers
│   │   ├── page.tsx         # Home page
│   │   └── globals.css      # Global styles
│   ├── components/          # Reusable components
│   │   ├── ui/              # shadcn/ui components
│   │   └── providers/       # Context providers
│   └── lib/                 # Utilities and configurations
│       ├── prisma.ts        # Database client
│       ├── auth/            # Authentication helpers
│       └── utils.ts         # Utility functions
├── prisma/
│   └── schema.prisma        # Database schema
├── public/                  # Static assets
├── package.json             # Dependencies
├── tailwind.config.ts       # Tailwind configuration
├── tsconfig.json            # TypeScript config
└── .env.example             # Environment template
```

## The Technology Stack Explained

### Why Next.js 15?

Next.js provides the perfect foundation for modern web applications:

- **Server Components** – Better performance and SEO
- **App Router** – Intuitive file-based routing
- **API Routes** – Backend functionality built-in
- **Streaming** – Progressive page rendering
- **Caching** – Intelligent request optimization

### Why Tailwind CSS v4?

The latest version of Tailwind offers significant improvements:

```css
/* Global styles with CSS variables */
@import "tailwindcss";

:root {
  --background: oklch(100% 0 0);
  --foreground: oklch(0% 0 0);
}

.dark {
  --background: oklch(14.9% 0 0);
  --foreground: oklch(100% 0 0);
}
```

Benefits include:

- **Native CSS** – No JavaScript runtime needed
- **OKLCH colors** – Better color consistency
- **Container queries** – Component-level responsiveness
- **Smaller bundle** – Faster page loads

### Why TypeScript?

Type safety catches errors before they reach production:

```typescript
interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  inStock: boolean;
}

function displayPrice(product: Product): string {
  // TypeScript ensures product has all required fields
  return `$${product.price.toFixed(2)}`;
}
```

## Pre-configured Services

Each template comes with optional integrations ready to use:

### Database (Prisma)

```typescript
import { prisma } from "@/lib/prisma";

// Query users with their posts
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  include: { posts: true },
});
```

### Authentication

```typescript
import { auth } from "@/lib/auth";

// Get current session
const session = await auth();
if (session?.user) {
  // User is authenticated
}
```

### Email (Resend)

```typescript
import { sendEmail } from "@/lib/email";

await sendEmail({
  to: "user@example.com",
  subject: "Welcome!",
  html: "<h1>Welcome to our platform</h1>",
});
```

### File Storage (R2)

```typescript
import { uploadFile } from "@/lib/storage";

const url = await uploadFile("images/profile.jpg", fileBuffer, "image/jpeg");
```

## How AI Modifies Templates

When you describe features to Craft's AI, it makes intelligent modifications:

1. **Analyzes existing code** – Understands the current structure
2. **Plans changes** – Determines what needs to be added or modified
3. **Generates code** – Creates new components or modifies existing ones
4. **Maintains consistency** – Follows the project's established patterns

### Example: Adding a Feature

You ask: _"Add a pricing section with three tiers"_

The AI will:

1. Create a new `PricingSection` component
2. Add it to the appropriate page
3. Style it consistently with existing components
4. Include proper TypeScript types
5. Ensure responsive design

## Environment Variables

Templates include a comprehensive `.env.example`:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."

# Authentication
AUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"

# Services
RESEND_API_KEY="re_..."
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..."
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

This makes it easy to configure services when deploying.

## Extending the Template

The template is designed to be extended. Common additions include:

### Adding shadcn/ui Components

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button card dialog
```

### Adding Prisma Models

```prisma
model Product {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  name        String
  price       Float
  description String?
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
}
```

### Adding API Routes

```typescript
// src/app/api/products/route.ts
export async function GET() {
  const products = await prisma.product.findMany();
  return Response.json(products);
}
```

## Best Practices Built In

Our templates include best practices by default:

| Practice         | Implementation               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Type Safety      | TypeScript strict mode       |
| Styling          | Tailwind with design tokens  |
| State Management | React context + Zustand      |
| Form Handling    | React Hook Form + Zod        |
| Error Handling   | Error boundaries + try/catch |
| Accessibility    | semantic HTML + ARIA         |

## Conclusion

The template system is the foundation that makes Craft projects maintainable, scalable, and production-ready from day one. By combining the best modern tools with sensible defaults, we enable you to focus on building features instead of configuration.

Understanding these internals helps you make the most of the platform, whether you're using natural language prompts or making direct modifications.
