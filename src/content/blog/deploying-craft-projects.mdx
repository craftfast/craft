# Best Practices for Deploying Your Craft Projects

You've built an amazing application with Craft. Now it's time to share it with the world. This guide covers everything you need to know about deploying your project to production.

## Deployment Options

Craft projects can be deployed to any platform that supports Next.js. Here are our recommended options:

### Vercel (Recommended)

Vercel is the creators of Next.js, making it the ideal platform for deployment:

**Pros:**

- Zero-configuration deployment
- Automatic HTTPS
- Edge functions support
- Built-in analytics
- Excellent performance

**Best for:** Most projects, especially those needing global performance

### Netlify

A popular alternative with great developer experience:

**Pros:**

- Simple deployment process
- Form handling built-in
- Split testing support
- Great documentation

**Best for:** Static sites and simpler applications

### Railway / Render

Full-featured platforms with database hosting:

**Pros:**

- Database hosting included
- Easy environment management
- Predictable pricing
- Good for full-stack apps

**Best for:** Applications needing databases and backend services

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying, make sure you've addressed these items:

### 1. Environment Variables

Never commit secrets to your repository. Set these in your deployment platform:

```bash
# Required
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
AUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"

# Optional (based on features used)
RESEND_API_KEY="re_..."
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..."
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."
R2_BUCKET_NAME="..."
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

### 2. Database Setup

If your app uses a database, you have several options:

| Provider    | Free Tier  | Best For            |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
| Neon        | 0.5 GB     | Most projects       |
| Supabase    | 500 MB     | Real-time features  |
| PlanetScale | 5 GB reads | High-read workloads |
| Railway     | $5/mo      | All-in-one solution |

### 3. Error Tracking

Add error monitoring to catch issues in production:

```typescript
// sentry.client.config.ts
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN,
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

### 4. Analytics

Understand how users interact with your app:

```typescript
// Using PostHog
import posthog from "posthog-js";

posthog.init(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY!, {
  api_host: "https://app.posthog.com",
});
```

## Step-by-Step: Deploying to Vercel

### Step 1: Connect Your Repository

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your Git repository
4. Vercel auto-detects Next.js settings

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

1. Go to Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add each required variable
3. Make sure to set them for Production environment

### Step 3: Deploy

1. Click "Deploy"
2. Wait for the build to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)
3. Your app is live!

### Step 4: Configure Custom Domain

1. Go to Settings → Domains
2. Add your domain
3. Update DNS records as instructed
4. SSL is automatically configured

## Performance Optimization

### Image Optimization

Use Next.js Image component for automatic optimization:

```typescript
import Image from "next/image";

<Image
  src="/hero-image.jpg"
  alt="Hero"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
  priority // Load immediately for above-fold images
/>;
```

### Code Splitting

Next.js automatically splits your code, but you can optimize further:

```typescript
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";

// Load heavy components only when needed
const HeavyChart = dynamic(() => import("./HeavyChart"), {
  loading: () => <div>Loading chart...</div>,
  ssr: false, // Disable server rendering if not needed
});
```

### Caching Strategies

Implement proper caching for API routes:

```typescript
// app/api/products/route.ts
export async function GET() {
  const products = await getProducts();

  return Response.json(products, {
    headers: {
      "Cache-Control": "s-maxage=60, stale-while-revalidate=300",
    },
  });
}
```

## Security Best Practices

### Content Security Policy

Configure CSP headers in `next.config.ts`:

```typescript
const securityHeaders = [
  {
    key: "Content-Security-Policy",
    value: "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';",
  },
];
```

### Rate Limiting

Protect your API routes from abuse:

```typescript
import { Ratelimit } from "@upstash/ratelimit";
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis";

const ratelimit = new Ratelimit({
  redis: Redis.fromEnv(),
  limiter: Ratelimit.slidingWindow(10, "10 s"),
});

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const ip = request.headers.get("x-forwarded-for");
  const { success } = await ratelimit.limit(ip || "anonymous");

  if (!success) {
    return new Response("Too Many Requests", { status: 429 });
  }

  // Process request...
}
```

### Input Validation

Always validate user input:

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

const schema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  name: z.string().min(2).max(100),
});

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const result = schema.safeParse(body);

  if (!result.success) {
    return Response.json({ error: result.error }, { status: 400 });
  }

  // Process validated data...
}
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks

Add a health check endpoint:

```typescript
// app/api/health/route.ts
export async function GET() {
  try {
    // Check database connection
    await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT 1`;

    return Response.json({ status: "healthy" });
  } catch (error) {
    return Response.json({ status: "unhealthy" }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

### Logging

Implement structured logging for debugging:

```typescript
const log = {
  info: (message: string, data?: object) => {
    console.log(JSON.stringify({ level: "info", message, ...data }));
  },
  error: (message: string, error?: Error) => {
    console.error(
      JSON.stringify({
        level: "error",
        message,
        error: error?.message,
      })
    );
  },
};
```

## Conclusion

Deploying your Craft project is straightforward when you follow these best practices. Remember:

1. ✅ Set up environment variables properly
2. ✅ Configure your database for production
3. ✅ Implement error tracking
4. ✅ Optimize performance
5. ✅ Follow security best practices
6. ✅ Set up monitoring

With these foundations in place, your application will be ready to handle real users and scale as needed.
