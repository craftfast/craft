# 5 Tips for Writing Better AI Prompts

The quality of your AI-generated code depends heavily on how well you communicate your requirements. In this guide, we'll share five proven techniques to help you get the most out of Craft's AI assistant.

## Tip 1: Be Specific About Design Details

Instead of vague descriptions, provide specific details about colors, spacing, and layout.

### ❌ Don't say:

```text
"Make a nice button"
```

### ✅ Do say:

```text
"Create a rounded button with a dark background, white text,
and a subtle hover effect that slightly lightens the background.
Make it full-width on mobile and auto-width on desktop."
```

The more specific you are, the closer the result will be to your vision.

## Tip 2: Provide Context and Purpose

Explain the purpose of what you're building. This helps the AI make better decisions about implementation details.

### ❌ Don't say:

```text
"Add a form"
```

### ✅ Do say:

```text
"Add a contact form for a consulting business that collects
the user's name, email, company, and a message. Include
validation for required fields and email format. Show a
success message after submission."
```

Understanding the context helps the AI choose appropriate validation rules, error messages, and user experience patterns.

## Tip 3: Reference Existing Patterns

When you want consistency with existing elements, reference them explicitly.

### ❌ Don't say:

```text
"Add another section"
```

### ✅ Do say:

```text
"Add a testimonials section below the features section,
using the same card style and spacing as the pricing cards.
Include a photo, name, role, and quote for each testimonial."
```

This ensures visual consistency throughout your application.

## Tip 4: Break Complex Tasks Into Steps

For complex features, break them down into smaller, manageable pieces.

### Instead of:

```text
"Build a complete e-commerce checkout system"
```

### Try:

```text
Step 1: "Create a cart page that displays items with
quantities, prices, and a subtotal"

Step 2: "Add a shipping address form with autocomplete
and validation"

Step 3: "Create an order summary component showing items,
shipping, taxes, and total"

Step 4: "Add a payment section with card input fields"
```

Building incrementally allows you to review and refine each piece before moving on.

## Tip 5: Describe the User Experience

Focus on how users will interact with your application, not just what it looks like.

### ❌ Don't say:

```text
"Make a dropdown menu"
```

### ✅ Do say:

```text
"Create a dropdown menu that opens on click, closes when
clicking outside, highlights items on hover, and supports
keyboard navigation. Include a smooth fade-in animation
when opening."
```

Describing interactions ensures the AI implements proper behavior and accessibility features.

## Bonus: Use Iteration to Refine

Don't expect perfection on the first try. Use follow-up prompts to refine:

```text
"Make the header sticky with a subtle shadow"
"Increase the padding on the cards"
"Change the accent color to a warmer tone"
"Make the text slightly larger on mobile"
```

Small, focused adjustments are often more effective than trying to specify everything upfront.

## Putting It All Together

Here's an example of a well-crafted prompt that incorporates all these tips:

```text
"Create a pricing section for a SaaS product with three tiers:
Starter ($9/mo), Pro ($29/mo), and Enterprise (custom pricing).

Each card should display:
- Tier name and price
- A short description
- A bullet list of 5-6 features
- A CTA button (primary style for Pro, secondary for others)

The Pro tier should be highlighted as the recommended option
with a 'Most Popular' badge. Use the same card styling as
the features section. On mobile, cards should stack vertically
with the Pro card first."
```

This prompt is:

- ✅ Specific about content and styling
- ✅ Provides business context
- ✅ References existing patterns
- ✅ Describes the user experience
- ✅ Clear and well-organized

## Practice Makes Perfect

The more you use Craft, the better you'll become at writing effective prompts. Pay attention to what works well and build your own library of prompt patterns.

Happy building! 🚀
