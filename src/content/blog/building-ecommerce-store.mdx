# Building a Complete E-commerce Store in Under an Hour

Think building an online store takes weeks of development? Think again. In this tutorial, we'll walk through creating a fully functional e-commerce store using Craft's AI-powered development tools.

## What We're Building

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a complete e-commerce store with:

- Product listing pages
- Product detail pages
- Shopping cart functionality
- Checkout process
- Responsive design for all devices

Let's get started!

## Step 1: Setting Up the Project (5 minutes)

First, create a new project in Craft. Name it something like "My Online Store" and start a conversation with the AI:

```text
"I'm building an e-commerce store for handmade jewelry.
Create a modern, elegant layout with a navigation bar,
hero section showcasing featured products, and a footer."
```

The AI will generate a clean starting point with:

- A responsive navigation with logo and menu items
- A stunning hero section
- A well-structured footer

## Step 2: Building the Product Grid (10 minutes)

Now let's add products. Describe what you need:

```text
"Create a product grid section below the hero. Each product card
should show an image placeholder, product name, price, and an
'Add to Cart' button. Start with 6 sample products with jewelry
names and prices ranging from $29 to $149."
```

The AI will create a beautiful grid layout with:

- Responsive columns (1 on mobile, 2 on tablet, 3 on desktop)
- Hover effects on cards
- Properly formatted prices
- Consistent styling

### Refining the Design

If you want to adjust the look:

```text
"Make the product cards have rounded corners and a subtle
shadow on hover. Add a 'Sale' badge option and a wishlist
heart icon in the top-right corner."
```

## Step 3: Creating Product Detail Pages (10 minutes)

Next, we need individual product pages:

```text
"Create a product detail page layout with:
- Large product image gallery (main image + thumbnails)
- Product name, price, and description
- Size and quantity selectors
- 'Add to Cart' button
- Product details accordion (Materials, Care, Shipping)
- Related products section at the bottom"
```

The AI will generate a comprehensive product page with all these elements, properly structured and styled.

## Step 4: Building the Shopping Cart (15 minutes)

Time for the cart functionality:

```text
"Create a shopping cart page that shows:
- List of cart items with image, name, price, and quantity controls
- Remove item button for each item
- Subtotal, shipping estimate, and total
- 'Continue Shopping' and 'Proceed to Checkout' buttons
- Empty cart state with a message and link to products"
```

For the cart sidebar/drawer:

```text
"Add a slide-in cart drawer that opens from the right side when
clicking 'Add to Cart' or the cart icon in the header. Show cart
items, total, and a checkout button."
```

## Step 5: Checkout Process (15 minutes)

Now let's create the checkout flow:

```text
"Create a checkout page with three sections:
1. Shipping Information - form for name, email, address, city,
   state, zip code, and phone
2. Shipping Method - radio options for Standard ($5.99, 5-7 days)
   and Express ($12.99, 2-3 days)
3. Payment - card number, expiry, CVV, and cardholder name fields

Include an order summary sidebar showing cart items and totals."
```

For a better user experience:

```text
"Add form validation to all required fields. Show inline error
messages for invalid inputs. Highlight the currently active
section with a progress indicator at the top."
```

## Step 6: Final Touches (5 minutes)

Polish your store with these finishing touches:

```text
"Add a sticky 'Add to Cart' bar that appears when scrolling past
the main button on product pages. Include the product name, price,
and a compact add to cart button."
```

```text
"Create a 'Thank You' page for successful orders with the order
number, confirmation message, and estimated delivery date. Include
a button to continue shopping."
```

## The Result

In under an hour, you've created:

| Feature              | Status |
| -------------------- | ------ |
| Product listing grid | ✅     |
| Product detail pages | ✅     |
| Shopping cart        | ✅     |
| Cart drawer          | ✅     |
| Checkout flow        | ✅     |
| Form validation      | ✅     |
| Order confirmation   | ✅     |
| Responsive design    | ✅     |

## Adding Real Data

To connect your store to real data, you can:

1. **Add environment variables** for your database connection
2. **Use Prisma** to define product and order schemas
3. **Connect a payment provider** like Stripe or Razorpay

Ask Craft to help:

```text
"Create a Prisma schema for products, cart items, and orders.
Include relationships between users, carts, and orders."
```

## Pro Tips for E-commerce

Here are some additional features you might want to add:

1. **Search functionality** - Help customers find products quickly
2. **Category filters** - Organize products by type, price, or collection
3. **Customer reviews** - Build trust with user-generated content
4. **Wishlist** - Let users save items for later
5. **Inventory tracking** - Manage stock levels

## Conclusion

Building an e-commerce store doesn't have to be a month-long project. With Craft's AI-powered development, you can create a professional, fully-functional online store in under an hour.

The key is to:

- Break down the project into clear steps
