# Projects

Projects are the foundation of everything you build in Craft. This guide explains how projects work, their structure, and how to manage them effectively.

## What is a Project?

A project in Craft is a complete web application with:

- Source code files
- Configuration
- Dependencies
- Environment variables
- Preview environment

Each project is isolated and has its own development environment.

## Project Structure

Every Craft project follows a consistent Next.js structure:

```
my-project/
├── src/
│   ├── app/              # App Router pages and layouts
│   │   ├── layout.tsx    # Root layout
│   │   ├── page.tsx      # Home page
│   │   └── api/          # API routes
│   ├── components/       # React components
│   └── lib/              # Utilities and helpers
├── public/               # Static assets
├── package.json          # Dependencies
├── tailwind.config.ts    # Tailwind configuration
└── tsconfig.json         # TypeScript configuration
```

## Creating a Project

### From Scratch

1. Click **"New Project"** on your dashboard
2. Enter a project name
3. Optionally select a template
4. Click **"Create"**

### From Template

Templates provide pre-built starting points:

- **Landing Page** - Marketing pages and portfolios
- **Dashboard** - Admin panels and data displays
- **E-commerce** - Product listings and shopping carts
- **Blog** - Content-focused sites

## Project Dashboard

The project dashboard shows:

### Overview Tab

- Project status and health
- Recent activity
- Quick actions

### Files Tab

- Browse all project files
- Create, edit, delete files
- Organize with folders

### Settings Tab

- Project name and description
- Environment variables
- Danger zone (delete project)

## Working with Files

### Creating Files

Ask the AI to create files:

```
Create a new component called ProductCard
in src/components/ProductCard.tsx
```

Or use the file browser:

1. Click the **+** button
2. Choose file type
3. Enter the file path

### Editing Files

- **With AI**: Describe the changes you want
- **Manually**: Click a file to open the editor

### Organizing Files

Follow these conventions:

| Type         | Location          |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| Pages        | `src/app/`        |
| Components   | `src/components/` |
| Utilities    | `src/lib/`        |
| API Routes   | `src/app/api/`    |
| Static Files | `public/`         |

## Project Settings

### General Settings

- **Name**: Display name for the project
- **Description**: Brief description (optional)
- **Visibility**: Public or private

### Environment Variables

Store sensitive configuration:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```

### Danger Zone

- **Archive Project**: Hide from dashboard
- **Delete Project**: Permanently remove

## Collaboration

> **Coming Soon**: Team collaboration features

Future updates will include:

- Invite team members
- Role-based permissions
- Real-time collaboration
- Comments and feedback

## Project Limits

Depending on your plan:

| Plan | Projects  | Storage | Preview Time |
| ---- | --------- | ------- | ------------ |
| Free | 3         | 500MB   | 2 hours/day  |
| Pro  | Unlimited | 5GB     | Unlimited    |
| Team | Unlimited | 50GB    | Unlimited    |

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names: `coffee-shop-landing` not `project1`
- Use lowercase with hyphens
- Keep names concise but meaningful

### Organization

- Group related projects in folders (coming soon)
- Archive completed projects
- Delete unused projects

### Regular Saves

The AI saves automatically, but:

- Check the save indicator
- Verify changes in preview
- Export important projects
