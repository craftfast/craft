# Live Preview

The live preview is one of Craft's most powerful features. It shows your application exactly as users will see it, updating in real-time as you make changes.

## How Live Preview Works

When you make changes in Craft, the preview:

1. Receives the updated code
2. Hot-reloads the affected components
3. Maintains application state when possible
4. Shows you the result instantly

No manual refresh needed!

## Using the Preview

### Preview Panel

The preview panel is located on the right side of the interface. You can:

- **Resize** by dragging the divider
- **Refresh** with the refresh button
- **Open in new tab** for full-screen testing
- **Copy link** to share with others

### Device Modes

Test on different screen sizes:

| Mode    | Width  | Use Case           |
| ------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Mobile  | 375px  | Phone layouts      |
| Tablet  | 768px  | iPad and similar   |
| Desktop | 1280px | Standard monitors  |
| Full    | 100%   | Responsive testing |

Click the device icons or use keyboard shortcuts:

- `⌘ + 1` - Mobile
- `⌘ + 2` - Tablet
- `⌘ + 3` - Desktop
- `⌘ + 4` - Full width

## Real-Time Updates

### What Updates Instantly

- Component changes
- Style modifications
- New pages and routes
- API route updates
- Configuration changes

### What Requires Refresh

- Environment variable changes
- Package installations
- Major structural changes

The preview will indicate when a refresh is needed.

## Interacting with the Preview

The preview is fully interactive:

- Click buttons and links
- Fill out forms
- Navigate between pages
- Test hover states
- Trigger animations

### Testing Forms

Forms in the preview work just like production:

1. Fill in fields
2. See validation in action
3. Submit and check responses
4. Verify error handling

### Testing Navigation

Click links to navigate:

- Internal links work normally
- External links open in new tabs
- API calls go to your routes

## Sharing Previews

### Share Link

Get a temporary link to share:

1. Click **"Share"** button
2. Copy the generated URL
3. Share with stakeholders

> **Note:** Share links expire after 24 hours

### Embed Preview

Embed in documentation or presentations:

```html
<iframe
  src="https://preview.craft.fast/your-project-id"
  width="100%"
  height="600"
></iframe>
```

## Preview vs Production

The preview environment is similar to production but with some differences:

| Feature       | Preview          | Production |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| Performance   | Development mode | Optimized  |
| Caching       | Disabled         | Enabled    |
| Error Details | Verbose          | Minimal    |
| Hot Reload    | Yes              | No         |

## Troubleshooting

### Preview Not Loading

1. Check your internet connection
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try refreshing the preview
4. Check for JavaScript errors in console

### Preview Out of Sync

If the preview doesn't match your code:

1. Click the refresh button
2. Wait for changes to apply
3. Check for save errors

### Slow Preview

Performance tips:

- Close unused browser tabs
- Use Chrome for best performance
- Disable browser extensions
- Check for infinite loops in code

### Console Errors

Open browser DevTools (`F12`) to see:

- JavaScript errors
- Network requests
- Console logs
- React component tree

## Best Practices

### Test Responsively

Always check your app on multiple device sizes:

1. Start with mobile design
2. Scale up to tablet
3. Verify desktop layout
4. Test edge cases (very wide/narrow)

### Test Interactions

Verify all interactive elements:

- Buttons trigger correct actions
- Forms validate properly
- Navigation works as expected
- Loading states display correctly

### Test Edge Cases

Check unusual scenarios:

- Empty states
- Long text content
- Many items in lists
- Slow network conditions
