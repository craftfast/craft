# AI Chat

The AI chat interface is your primary way of building with Craft. This guide helps you communicate effectively with the AI to get the best results.

## How It Works

The AI assistant in Craft is designed to:

1. **Understand** your requirements from natural language
2. **Generate** high-quality code that follows best practices
3. **Explain** what it's doing and why
4. **Iterate** based on your feedback

## Starting a Conversation

Begin with a clear description of what you want:

```
Create a contact form with name, email, and message fields.
Include validation and a submit button that shows a success message.
```

The AI will:

- Create the necessary component files
- Add proper TypeScript types
- Include form validation
- Style with Tailwind CSS

## Conversation Context

The AI remembers your entire conversation, so you can build on previous messages:

**Message 1:**

```
Create a navigation bar with a logo and menu items
```

**Message 2:**

```
Add a mobile hamburger menu that slides in from the right
```

**Message 3:**

```
Make the background blur when the mobile menu is open
```

## Effective Prompting

### Be Specific

❌ Vague:

```
Make a form
```

✅ Specific:

```
Create a newsletter signup form with an email input,
submit button, and success/error states.
Style it with a dark background and light text.
```

### Provide Context

Include relevant details:

```
Create a pricing table for a SaaS product with:
- 3 tiers: Starter ($9), Pro ($29), Enterprise ($99)
- Monthly/yearly toggle
- Feature comparison
- "Most Popular" badge on Pro tier
```

### Reference Styles

Mention designs you like:

```
Create a hero section inspired by Linear's website,
with a gradient background and animated text.
```

### Break Down Complex Tasks

For large features, work step by step:

```
Step 1: Create the basic layout structure
Step 2: Add the header and navigation
Step 3: Build the main content area
Step 4: Add animations and polish
```

## Common Commands

### Creating Components

```
Create a Button component with variants:
primary, secondary, outline, and ghost
```

### Modifying Code

```
Update the Header component to include a search bar
```

### Fixing Issues

```
The form isn't submitting correctly, can you fix it?
```

### Styling

```
Change the color scheme to use blue as the primary color
```

### Adding Features

```
Add dark mode support to the entire application
```

## Understanding AI Responses

The AI typically responds with:

1. **Explanation** - What it's about to do
2. **Code Changes** - Files being created or modified
3. **Notes** - Important considerations or next steps

### Example Response Structure

> I'll create a contact form component with validation. This will include:
>
> - Form component with controlled inputs
> - Validation using Zod schema
> - Error message display
> - Loading state during submission
>
> _[Files are created/modified]_
>
> The form is ready! You might want to add an API route to handle submissions.

## Tips for Better Results

### Use Technical Terms When Helpful

The AI understands technical concepts:

```
Create a React component with useState for form data
and useEffect to fetch initial values from the API
```

### Ask for Explanations

If you want to learn:

```
Create a debounced search input and explain how debouncing works
```

### Request Alternatives

Get multiple options:

```
Show me 3 different ways to style this card component
```

### Iterate Gradually

Build complexity over time:

1. Start with structure
2. Add functionality
3. Polish styling
4. Add animations
5. Optimize performance

## Limitations

Be aware that the AI:

- Cannot access external APIs or databases directly
- May need clarification for ambiguous requests
- Works best with clear, specific instructions
- Focuses on frontend development
