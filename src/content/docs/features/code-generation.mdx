# Code Generation

Craft's AI-powered code generation helps you build applications faster while maintaining high quality. This guide covers advanced techniques for getting the most from AI code generation.

## Understanding Code Generation

When you describe what you want, the AI:

1. Analyzes your requirements
2. Considers the project context
3. Generates appropriate code
4. Follows best practices automatically

## Generation Capabilities

### Components

Generate complete React components:

```
Create a data table component with:
- Sortable columns
- Pagination
- Row selection
- Search filtering
- Loading state
```

### Pages

Create entire pages with layout:

```
Build a user profile page with:
- Profile header with avatar and name
- Stats section showing followers and posts
- Tabs for posts, likes, and saved items
- Activity feed
```

### API Routes

Generate backend endpoints:

```
Create an API route at /api/users that:
- GET: Returns paginated user list
- POST: Creates a new user with validation
- Handles authentication
- Returns proper error responses
```

### Utilities

Generate helper functions:

```
Create a utility function that:
- Formats currency with proper locale
- Handles multiple currencies
- Includes TypeScript types
```

## Code Quality

### TypeScript Integration

All generated code includes proper TypeScript:

```tsx
interface UserProfileProps {
  user: User;
  onEdit?: () => void;
  className?: string;
}

export function UserProfile({ user, onEdit, className }: UserProfileProps) {
  // Component implementation
}
```

### Best Practices

Generated code follows:

- **React patterns** - Proper hooks usage, memo when beneficial
- **TypeScript** - Strong typing, interfaces over types when appropriate
- **Accessibility** - ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
- **Performance** - Lazy loading, optimized renders

### Styling Conventions

Tailwind CSS is used consistently:

- Utility-first approach
- Responsive breakpoints
- Dark mode support
- Design system colors

## Advanced Techniques

### Multi-File Generation

Request related files together:

```
Create a product feature with:
1. ProductCard component
2. ProductGrid layout
3. ProductDetails page
4. useProduct hook for data fetching
5. Product TypeScript types
```

### Incremental Building

Build complex features step by step:

**Round 1:**

```
Create the basic layout structure for an e-commerce site
```

**Round 2:**

```
Add the product listing page with grid layout
```

**Round 3:**

```
Implement add-to-cart functionality with a cart sidebar
```

### Reference Existing Code

Point to existing patterns:

```
Create a SettingsPage component following the same
pattern as the existing ProfilePage component
```

### Specify Libraries

Request specific implementations:

```
Create a form using react-hook-form with zod validation,
similar to the login form pattern
```

## Regeneration and Refinement

### Requesting Changes

If the generated code isn't quite right:

```
Update the ProductCard to:
- Use a horizontal layout instead of vertical
- Add a wishlist button
- Show stock status
```

### Partial Regeneration

Update specific parts only:

```
Just change the styling of the header section,
keep everything else the same
```

### Alternative Approaches

Ask for different implementations:

```
Show me a different way to implement the pagination,
using URL parameters instead of state
```

## Generation Patterns

### CRUD Operations

```
Create a complete CRUD interface for managing blog posts:
- List view with search and filters
- Create form with rich text editor
- Edit page with form pre-population
- Delete with confirmation modal
- Proper loading and error states
```

### Authentication Flow

```
Build an authentication system with:
- Login page
- Registration page
- Password reset flow
- Protected route wrapper
- Session management
```

### Data Visualization

```
Create a dashboard with:
- Line chart for revenue over time
- Bar chart for top products
- Pie chart for traffic sources
- Real-time updating stats cards
```

## Code Generation Limits

Be aware of limitations:

- Very complex algorithms may need refinement
- External API integrations need credentials
- Database queries require schema context
- Some edge cases may need manual handling

## Tips for Better Code

### Provide Context

The more context, the better:

```
I'm building a SaaS dashboard for project management.
Create a task list component that shows tasks with
priority, assignee, due date, and status. Users should
be able to drag tasks to reorder them.
```

### Specify Constraints

Mention important requirements:

```
Create a file upload component that:
- Accepts only images (jpg, png, webp)
- Has a 5MB size limit
- Shows upload progress
- Validates on the client side
```

### Request Documentation

Ask for comments and documentation:

```
Create a utility for handling API requests with
proper error handling. Include JSDoc comments
explaining each function.
```
