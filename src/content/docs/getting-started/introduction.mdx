# Introduction to Craft

Welcome to **Craft** — the AI-powered development platform that transforms how you build web applications. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, Craft helps you create production-ready applications through natural conversation.

## What is Craft?

Craft is a revolutionary development environment that combines the power of AI with modern web technologies. Instead of writing every line of code manually, you describe what you want to build, and Craft helps bring your vision to life.

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Development

Chat with an intelligent AI assistant that understands your requirements and generates high-quality code. The AI can:

- Create complete React components
- Set up API routes and database schemas
- Implement complex business logic
- Fix bugs and optimize performance

### Live Preview

See your changes in real-time with our integrated preview system. Every modification is instantly reflected, giving you immediate feedback on your work.

### Modern Tech Stack

Craft projects are built on a solid foundation:

- **Next.js 15** for the framework
- **React 19** for the UI

- **Prisma** for database operations
