# Installation

Craft is a web-based platform, so there's no local installation required. However, this guide covers everything you need to know about setting up your account and optional local development tools.

## Getting Started with Craft

### Creating Your Account

1. Visit [craft.fast](https://craft.fast)
2. Click **"Get Started"** or **"Sign Up"**
3. Choose your sign-in method:
   - **Google** - Quick sign-in with your Google account
   - **GitHub** - Connect with your GitHub account
   - **Email** - Traditional email and password

### Choosing a Plan

Craft offers several plans to fit your needs:

| Feature        | Free     | Pro       | Team      |
| -------------- | -------- | --------- | --------- |
| Projects       | 3        | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| AI Messages    | 50/month | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Live Preview   | ✓        | ✓         | ✓         |
| Custom Domains | ✗        | ✓         | ✓         |
| Collaboration  | ✗        | ✗         | ✓         |

## Browser Requirements

Craft works best on modern browsers:

- **Chrome** 90+ (recommended)
- **Firefox** 88+
- **Safari** 14+
- **Edge** 90+

For the best experience, we recommend using Chrome or Firefox with hardware acceleration enabled.

## Optional: Local Development

While Craft handles everything in the browser, you can also export and run projects locally.

### Exporting a Project

1. Open your project in Craft
2. Click the **Settings** icon
3. Select **"Export Project"**
4. Choose your export format (ZIP or GitHub)

### Running Locally

After exporting, you can run the project on your machine:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
pnpm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

### Required Local Tools

If you plan to run projects locally, you'll need:

- **Node.js** 18.0 or later
- **npm** 9+ or **pnpm** 8+
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

## Environment Setup

### Environment Variables

Some features require environment variables. In Craft, you can set these in the project settings:

1. Open Project Settings
2. Navigate to **Environment Variables**
3. Add your variables (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `API_KEY`)

> **Note:** Environment variables are encrypted and stored securely.

### Database Setup

Craft supports various databases:

- **PostgreSQL** (recommended)
- **MySQL**
- **SQLite** (development only)
- **PlanetScale**
- **Supabase**

See [Database Integration](/docs/features/database-integration) for detailed setup instructions.

## Verification

To verify everything is set up correctly:

1. Create a new project
2. Ask the AI to create a simple component
3. Check that the preview updates
4. Try making a small change

If all these work, you're ready to start building!

## Troubleshooting

### Preview Not Loading

- Clear your browser cache
- Disable browser extensions temporarily
- Try a different browser
- Check your internet connection

### AI Not Responding

- Verify you have remaining AI messages
- Check your account status
- Try refreshing the page

### Export Issues

- Ensure all files are saved
- Check for any error notifications
- Try exporting as ZIP instead of GitHub
