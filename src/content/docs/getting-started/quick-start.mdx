# Quick Start

Get up and running with Craft in just a few minutes. This guide will walk you through creating your first project and understanding the basics of AI-powered development.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A Craft account (sign up at [craft.fast](https://craft.fast))
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- An idea for what you want to build!

## Step 1: Create a New Project

1. Log in to your Craft dashboard
2. Click the **"New Project"** button
3. Give your project a descriptive name
4. Click **"Create"** to initialize your project

## Step 2: Start a Conversation

Once your project is created, you'll see the chat interface. This is where you'll communicate with the AI assistant.

Try starting with a simple prompt:

```
Create a landing page for a coffee shop called "Bean There"
with a hero section, menu preview, and contact form.
```

## Step 3: Watch the Magic Happen

The AI will:

1. Analyze your request
2. Generate the necessary code
3. Create the file structure
4. Update the preview in real-time

You'll see files being created in the sidebar and the live preview updating as the AI works.

## Step 4: Iterate and Refine

Don't like something? Just ask for changes:

```
Change the color scheme to warm earth tones
and add a photo gallery section.
```

The AI will understand context from your previous messages and make the requested changes.

## Step 5: Preview Your Work

Click on the **Preview** tab to see your application in action. You can:

- View on different screen sizes
- Test interactive elements
- Share the preview link with others

## Example Prompts to Try

Here are some prompts to get you started:

### Landing Page

```
Create a modern SaaS landing page with:
- Animated hero section
- Feature highlights with icons
- Pricing table with 3 tiers
- FAQ accordion
- Newsletter signup footer
```

### Dashboard

```
Build an admin dashboard with:
- Sidebar navigation
- Stats cards showing key metrics
- Recent activity feed
- User table with search and pagination
```

### E-commerce

```
Design a product page with:
- Image gallery with zoom
- Size and color selectors
- Add to cart button
- Customer reviews section
- Related products carousel
```

## Tips for Better Results

### Be Specific

The more details you provide, the better the result:

❌ "Make a website"  
✅ "Create a portfolio website for a photographer with a grid gallery, about page, and contact form"

### Use Reference Points

Mention styles or sites you like:

```
Create a pricing page similar to Stripe's design,
with a clean white background and subtle shadows.
```

### Iterate Gradually

Build up complexity over time:

1. Start with basic structure
2. Add styling and polish
3. Implement interactivity
4. Add final touches
