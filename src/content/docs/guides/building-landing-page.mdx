# Building a Landing Page

Learn how to create a beautiful, conversion-optimized landing page with Craft. This step-by-step guide walks through the entire process.

## What We'll Build

A professional landing page with:

- Hero section with headline and CTA
- Feature highlights
- Social proof (testimonials)
- Pricing section
- FAQ accordion
- Newsletter signup
- Footer

## Step 1: Project Setup

Start a new project and set the context:

```
Create a landing page for "Flowstate" - a productivity app
that helps remote teams stay in flow. The design should be
modern, clean, and use purple as the primary color.
```

## Step 2: Hero Section

The hero is the first thing visitors see:

```
Create a hero section with:
- Large headline: "Stay in Flow, Ship Faster"
- Subheadline explaining the product value
- "Start Free Trial" primary button
- "Watch Demo" secondary button
- Hero image or illustration on the right
- Animated gradient background
```

### Tips for Great Heroes

- Keep headlines concise (5-8 words)
- Focus on benefits, not features
- Use action-oriented CTAs
- Add social proof near the CTA

## Step 3: Feature Section

Highlight key features:

```

3. Distraction Blocker - Block notifications
4. Analytics - Track productivity trends

Each feature should have an icon, title, and description.
```

### Feature Best Practices

## Step 4: Social Proof

Add credibility with testimonials:

```

   - Marcus Johnson, Founder of StartupXYZ
