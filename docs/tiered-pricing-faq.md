# Tiered Pricing FAQ

## General Questions

### What is tiered credit-based pricing?

Tiered pricing allows you to choose exactly how many credits you need each month (from 100 to 10,000), and you only pay for what you select. The more credits you need, the more you pay - it's a simple, linear pricing model.

### How is this different from the old pricing?

Previously, Pro and Business plans had fixed credit amounts (100 credits each). Now, you can select anywhere from 100 to 10,000 credits in multiples of 100, giving you much more flexibility to match your actual usage.

### Can I change my credit amount later?

Yes! You can upgrade or downgrade your credit allocation at any time:

- **Upgrades**: Take effect immediately
- **Downgrades**: Apply at the next billing cycle

## Credit Selection

### What credit amounts can I choose?

- **Minimum**: 100 credits
- **Maximum**: 10,000 credits
- **Increment**: Must be in multiples of 100 (e.g., 100, 200, 300, 400, etc.)

### Are there recommended credit tiers?

Yes, we provide quick-select buttons for common tiers:

- 100 credits (starter)
- 200 credits (regular)
- 500 credits (active)
- 1,000 credits (1K - small team)
- 2,000 credits (2K - growing team)
- 5,000 credits (5K - large team)
- 10,000 credits (10K - power users)

You can also enter any custom amount between 100-10,000 in the input field.

### What if I need more than 10,000 credits?

For requirements beyond 10,000 credits per month, please contact our sales team at sales@craft.tech for a custom Enterprise plan.

## Pricing Calculation

**Pro Plan**: Credits × $0.25 (or Credits × ₹20.75 for INR)
**Business Plan**: Credits × $0.50 (or Credits × ₹41.50 for INR)

### Are there any volume discounts?
